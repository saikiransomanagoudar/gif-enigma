## Progressive Hint Design

Each GIF hint progressively reveals more details about the secret word or phrase. Here are some example approaches:

### Example 1: Secret Word - "Clock"

- **GIF 1**: An abstract clue—swirling colors or blurred images suggesting the motion of clock hands.
- **GIF 2**: A more defined image—perhaps a clock face with soft focus on numbers.
- **GIF 3**: A closer look—a clock with visible gears and mechanical details.
- **GIF 4**: A direct hint—an unmistakable clock striking a particular hour, with the word "Clock" subtly highlighted.

### Example 2: Secret Phrase - "Jurassic Park"

- **GIF 1**: An abstract clue—imagine a shaking earth to hint at ancient, unsettled times.
- **GIF 2**: Adding context—a silhouette of a dinosaur blended with the shaking earth.
- **GIF 3**: Getting closer—a clearer depiction of a dinosaur or an iconic element from the movie.
- **GIF 4**: A direct hint—a roaring T-Rex with a text overlay that reads "Jurassic Park".

These progressive hints are designed to logically guide players toward the answer without the need for human moderation.
