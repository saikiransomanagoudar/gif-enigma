Want to design your own GIF Enigma puzzle? Use Creator Mode to craft unique challenges:

1. **Select a Category**: Choose from Movies, Games, Books, or General Topic.
2. **Secret Word/Phrase Selection**: Based on your chosen category, you’ll be presented with 10 secret words/phrases (toggle between word and phrase as needed).
3. **Choose Your GIF Hints**: For each of the 4 progressive hints, you’ll see a list of 8 GIFs. Select the ones that best represent your intended clues.
4. **Post to Subreddit**: Once you finalize your secret word/phrase and hints, your puzzle will be posted to the subreddit for players to solve.

## Progressive Hint Design

Each GIF hint progressively reveals more details about the secret word or phrase. Here are some example approaches:

### Example 1: Secret Word - "Clock"

- **GIF 1 (Abstract Connection)**: Suggested search term – _`rotation`_ &rarr; _Shows spinning or circular motion_
- **GIF 2 (Thematic Element)**: Suggested search term – _`ticktock`_ &rarr; _Reveals rhythmic movement or sound_
- **GIF 3 (Visual Component)**: Suggested search term – _`mechanism`_ &rarr; _Displays gears or inner workings_
- **GIF 4 (Direct Clue)**: Suggested search term – _`chiming`_ &rarr; _Shows bells ringing or time indication_

### Example 2: Secret Phrase - "Jurassic Park"

- **GIF 1 (Setting the Scene)**: Suggested search term - `ancient earth` &rarr; _Depicts prehistoric landscapes_
- **GIF 2 (Introducing Subject)**: Suggested search term – `dinosaur shadow` &rarr; _Shows silhouettes or fossils_
- **GIF 3 (Adding Tension)**: Suggested search term – `carnivore call` &rarr; _Displays predatory behavior_
- **GIF 4 (Iconic Reference)**: Suggested search term – `roaring dino` &rarr; _Features recognizable dinosaur imagery_

#### _Note:_ These search terms are suggested by Google's Gemini API and serve as queries for the Tenor API, allowing you to select GIFs that create a progression of hints from subtle to more obvious.

## Additional Information

- **Starting Score**: You start with a potential 100 points. Each hint reduces your score, but solving the enigma without using any GIF hints or Word/Phrase hints earns you a perfect 100 points.
- **Enjoy the Challenge**: Both players and creators can enjoy the game. Whether you're solving the enigma or crafting your own, GIF Enigma aims to bring fun to the Reddit community.
- **Community Driven**: Puzzles created in Creator Mode are shared with the community on the subreddit for everyone to enjoy.

Happy puzzling!
