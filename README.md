# GIF Enigma

GIF Enigma is a word/phrase-guessing game where players interpret GIFs to uncover a hidden word or phrase. A fun and engaging challenge that tests your ability to think visually and make connections. Can you solve the enigma?

## How to Play

1. **View the GIF**: A GIF is displayed. Your task is to guess the word or phrase that the GIF represents or that it inspires.
2. **Click Scrambled Letters**: The secret word/phrase is shown as scrambled letter buttons. Click them to fill the answer boxes in order.
3. **Use Hints**: You can reveal up to 4 GIF hints. There's also a word/phrase hint option that reveals letters and greys out the corresponding scrambled buttons.
4. **Undo & Shuffle**: Made a mistake? Use the undo button to remove letters, or shuffle to rearrange the scrambled letters.
5. **Scoring**: You start with 100 points. Points are deducted as hints are used.

2. **Secret Word/Phrase Selection**: Based on your chosen category, you’ll be presented with 10 secret words/phrases (toggle between word and phrase as needed).
3. **Choose Your GIF Hints**: For each of the 4 progressive hints, you’ll see a list of 12 GIFs. Select the ones that best represent your intended clues.

## Progressive Hint Design

Each GIF hint progressively reveals more details about the secret word or phrase. Here are some example approaches:
