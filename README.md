## Progressive Hint Design

Each GIF hint progressively reveals more details about the secret word or phrase. Here are some example approaches:

### Example 1: Secret Word - "Clock"

- **GIF 1 (Abstract Connection)**: Suggested search term â€“ _`rotation`_ &rarr; _Shows spinning or circular motion_
- **GIF 2 (Thematic Element)**: Suggested search term â€“ _`ticktock`_ &rarr; _Reveals rhythmic movement or sound_
- **GIF 3 (Visual Component)**: Suggested search term â€“ _`mechanism`_ &rarr; _Displays gears or inner workings_
- **GIF 4 (Direct Clue)**: Suggested search term â€“ _`chiming`_ &rarr; _Shows bells ringing or time indication_

### Example 2: Secret Phrase - "Jurassic Park"

- **GIF 1 (Setting the Scene)**: Suggested search term - `ancient earth` &rarr; _Depicts prehistoric landscapes_
- **GIF 2 (Introducing Subject)**: Suggested search term â€“ `dinosaur shadow` &rarr; _Shows silhouettes or fossils_
- **GIF 3 (Adding Tension)**: Suggested search term â€“ `carnivore call` &rarr; _Displays predatory behavior_
- **GIF 4 (Iconic Reference)**: Suggested search term â€“ `roaring dino` &rarr; _Features recognizable dinosaur imagery_

#### _Note:_ These search terms are suggested by Google's Gemini API and serve as queries for the Tenor API, allowing you to select GIFs that create a progression of hints from subtle to more obvious.
