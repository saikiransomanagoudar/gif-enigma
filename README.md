# GIF Enigma ðŸŽ¬

GIF Enigma is a word/phrase-guessing game where players interpret GIFs to uncover a hidden word or phrase. A fun and engaging challenge that tests your ability to think visually and make connections. Can you solve the enigma?

## How to Play

1. **View the GIF**: A GIF is displayed. Your task is to guess the word or phrase that the GIF represents or that it inspires.
2. **Use Hints**: You can reveal up to 4 GIF hints. Thereâ€™s also a word/phrase hint option that adjusts based on the answerâ€™s length.
3. **Scoring**: You start with 100 points. Points are deducted as hints are used.

## Creator Mode

1. **Select a Category**: Choose from Movies, Games, Books, or General Topic.
2. **Secret Word/Phrase Selection**: Based on your chosen category, youâ€™ll be presented with 10 secret words/phrases (toggle between word and phrase as needed).
3. **Choose Your GIF Hints**: For each of the 4 progressive hints, youâ€™ll see a list of 8 GIFs. Select the ones that best represent your intended clues.
4. **Post to Subreddit**: Once you finalize your secret word/phrase and hints, your puzzle will be posted to the subreddit for players to solve.
